# ODK Collect

Simplified Explanation: Imagine a digital clipboard for surveys. ODK Collect is an Android app that lets you fill out surveys on your phone or tablet, even without internet. It replaces paper forms, making data collection faster and more accurate.  At the end of data collection, the form is finalized and sent to a server.

Real-world Example: A health worker uses ODK Collect to record patient symptoms in remote villages where there's no internet.
