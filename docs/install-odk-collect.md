# Installing ODK Collect 


Just like any other Android App, you download ODK Collect from the Google Play Store.  You download it like you would WhatsApp or Viber or Messenger.

## Here are the steps:

- Make sure you have an internet connection.
- Get your Android Device.
- Open the Google Play Store app.
- Search for "ODK Collect"
- Tap "Install" and wait for the app to download and install

To update the App, go through the same process and choose Update.

## Permissions

When you open the app for the first time, it will ask for permissions (like accessing your camera or location). These are crucial for ODK Collect to function correctly for things like taking photos in surveys or recording GPS coordinates.

These are the only permissions that ODK Collect will ask from you.  
| Permission | Reason |
|---| ---|
| Storage | required for Collect to be able to access and save form data |
| Camera | required by image and video questions to capture new media |
| Location | required for location questions |
| Microphone | required by audio and video questions to capture new media|
