# Using ODK Collect

ODK Collect works with a computer that connects securely with the ODK Collect to send and receive information.  These types of computers are called "servers".  The server we use is called ODK Central.  ODK Central stores the blank survey forms that you will use in your study.  You will use ODK Collect to download these blank forms.  After entering data in these forms, you will then send the data back to the ODK Central which receives and stores the data you collected. If the data collector does not send the data in ODK Collect to ODK Central, the data is not centrally stored and is therefore at risk of getting lost.  As a data collector, you will not have access to ODK Central, but it is important for you to understand how this works with ODK Collect.
This is just like how your email or messaging apps connect to a server to get your messages and send new ones.
