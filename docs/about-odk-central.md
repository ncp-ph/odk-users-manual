Blank Forms
Finalized Forms with Data

ODK Central is the hub that controls the ODK Ecosystem. ODK Central manages users, forms, permissions and data flow. XLSForms created in a computer are uploaded to ODK Central.  These forms are then downloaded into the ODK Collect App as blank forms.  Data collected using these Forms  are processed within ODK Collect and sent back to ODK Central.  These are called Submissions.  These Submissions can then be exported as data for analysis.
